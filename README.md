##About Me

Hello! My name is Katie and I am a first year MSc student in Zoology. I am studying the effects nurtient inputs, stream flow, and temperature on the extent of hypoxia in Salish Sucker (_Castostomus sp. cf. catostomus_) critial habitat. I am also studying Coho salmon (_Oncorhynchus kisutch_) :fish:

I am an avid fishing :fishing_pole_and_fish: enthusiast and I spend most of my spare time outside. I hope that my research will eventually have a role in helping species that are affected by development.
